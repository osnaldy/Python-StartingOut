When you hear the word dictionary.
You probably think about a large book such as the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
Containing words and their definitions.
If you want to know the meaning of a particular word.
You locate it in the dictionary to find its definition.
In Python a dictionary is an object that stores a collection of data.
Each element that is stored in a dictionary has two parts a key and a value.
In fact dictionary elements are commonly referred to as key-value pairs.
When you want to retrieve a specific value from a dictionary.
You use the key that is associated with that value.
This is similar to the process of looking up a word in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
Where the words are keys and the definitions are values.

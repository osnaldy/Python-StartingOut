Once you have made it to the box office and gotten your tickets
you are confronted with the problems of the theater itself
If you are in one of the run-down older theaters
you must adjust to the musty smell of seldom-cleaned carpets
Escaped springs lurk in the faded plush or cracked leather seats
and half the seats you sit in seem loose or tilted so that you sit at a strange angle
The newer twin and quad theaters offer their own problems
Sitting in an area only one-quarter the size of a regular theater
moviegoers often have to put up with the sound of the movie next door
This is especially jarring when the other movie involves racing cars or a karate
war and you are trying to enjoy a quiet love story. And whether the theater is old or new
it will have floors that seem to be coated with rubber cement
By the end of a movie shoes almost have to be pried off the floor because they have become
sealed to a deadly compound of spilled soda hardening bubble gum, and crushed Ju-Jubes
